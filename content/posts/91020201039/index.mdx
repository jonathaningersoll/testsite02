### Morning Challenge

This morning I woke up early to get a good start on our challenge which was to create a little page in HTML and then edit the CSS. The challenge itself increased in varying levels of difficulty, which was nice, and I did learn more about the precise difference between the thead and the th tags.

### JavaScript Time

At this point we are introduced to creating comments in JavaScript and then variables.
Most of this is a very basic introduction to basic concepts.
The largest benefit as an auditory learner is hearing someone talk about the basics rather than wondering what the exceptions are.

Oh, and my left ear popped open during class. Not all the way, but back to last night's ability.

### Challenge:
Our challenge this evening is to create a creature out of CSS code. I initially attempted an R2-D2, but I think I will be doing a minimalist Chewbacca.
