# Starting Over With JavaScript

Free is great. So when I was given the opportunity to avail myself of a grant to attend another ElevenFifty class for free, I took it. This time, instead of Software Development, I decided to hone in on JavaScript and took the Web Development track.

## Introductions are in order
Yesterday was day 01 which meant getting everyone on the same page. Leading a class of about thirty people is probably like attempting to sail 30 individual ships in a river. Most of the ships are going to move together, but some will eventually need some more attention as they invariably get caught in a current.

Some folks were not using Windows, and, thus, needed ever-so-slightly different instructions on how to do things. Some did not achieve the same result as the rest of the class when attempting to execute their code.

## New things learned
I did learn something new - I learned about the CSS Flexbox.
According to W3C Schools, there are five layout modes:
- Block, for sections on a webpage
- Inline, for text
- Table, for two-dimensional table data
- Positioned, for explicit positioning of an element

Flexbox eliminates the need to constantly wrestle with floats.

Assign the display: flexbox; and you're set to adjust as needed. Very handy to use instead of floats. I need to explore whether this depricates floats.
